## Loop

Noise alerts puppets within hear radius. Knocking a calm puppet has a 50% kill chance; miss or enraged miss escalates. More noise while chased can wake the rest.

## PlayerStats (redesign foundation, step 1)
- Autoload `PlayerStats` (`scripts/autoload/player_stats.gd`) is the only place player numbers live (`BASE` dict).
- Read: `PlayerStats.get_stat(&"pickup_time")`. Items change stats only via `add_modifier(stat, add, mul, source)` / `remove_modifiers_from(source)`.
- Health: 3 hits (`take_hit`) = `died` + `GameState.on_caught()`. Gold: `add_gold`, `try_spend`.
- Signals for FE: `health_changed(current, max)`, `gold_changed(current, delta)`, `stat_changed(stat, value)`, `died`.
- Input map actions (no hard-coded keys): `move_left/right/up/down`, `jump` (Space), `flashlight_toggle` (RMB toggle), `interact` (LMB: tap < `tap_threshold` = throw, hold = pickup), `inv_next`/`inv_prev` (wheel).

## NoiseBus, WorldObject, Inventory, pickup and throw (foundation step 2)
- `NoiseBus.emit_noise(at, radius, loudness, source)`: every sound goes here. Enemies hear it if they're inside `radius`, on screen or not. `DEFAULT_RADIUS` is 760px, slightly past the screen edge.
- `WorldObject` (`scripts/world/world_object.gd`) is the base for all props. Override the defaults in a subclass `_init()`: `can_pick_up`, `throwable`, `breakable`, `break_on_touch`, `noise_radius`, `pickup_time_mult`, `gold_inside`, `blocks_throws`, `art_slot`.
- `Vase` is pickable and throwable, uses the default radius, and has a 45% chance of 1 to 3 gold. `obstacle.gd` is a generic breakable that can't be picked up.
- Player: a LMB tap throws the held item at `FESignals.selected_enemy`. With empty hands, a tap knocks over the nearest prop you're facing. Holding LMB longer than `tap_threshold` starts a pickup that lasts `pickup_time * pickup_time_mult`. During a pickup you can't move or toggle the light. The pickup cancels if you leave range, get hit, or let go. The wheel cycles the `Inventory` (capacity is `inventory_slots`).
- A thrown object flies at the target. Physics bodies (walls) and props with `blocks_throws` stop it. It always shatters with its own noise radius where it stops, so a miss is still loud. A calm puppet that gets hit dies, and an enraged one is stunned for 1.5s.
- Hovering the mouse over a lit puppet selects it through `FESignals.select_enemy`. The selection stays when the light goes off.
- Not done yet: the jump and gravity wait for Lead's floor layout.

## Jump, stairs, animation (foundation step 3)
- `PlayerController.side_scroll` turns on gravity (`PlayerStats.gravity` 980), the Space jump (`jump_velocity` 320, about 52px, so you can't jump to the floor above), and stairs. The generator sets it to true. The old top-down map leaves it off.
- `Stair` (`scripts/world/stair.gd`) is an `Area2D` with local `bottom` and `top` points. Up or down while you're on it enters `CLIMB`, you move along the line at `climb_speed`, and you step off at either end. There's no jumping during pickup or climbing.
- The boy, the puppet and the exit door get their animations only from manifest slots through `AnimLibrary` (`boy_idle/run/jump/pickup/carry/throw/climb_stairs/hurt`, `puppet_calm/startle/chase`, `exit_door`). No BE script loads an art path anymore.
